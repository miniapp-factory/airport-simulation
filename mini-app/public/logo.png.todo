An airplane flying over a stylized map of the world, with a clear blue sky background and a subtle gradient. The airplane is depicted in a sleek, modern silhouette, positioned slightly above the horizon line, giving a sense of motion and altitude. The background shows a faint, abstract representation of continents in muted tones, with a light blue gradient from top to bottom to suggest a clear sky. The overall composition is clean, minimalistic, and conveys the theme of flight and simulation.
